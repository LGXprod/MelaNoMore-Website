        <h1>Meet the MelaNoMore Team!</h1>

        <p>
          Melanoma is the third most common cancer in Australia, with 15,000
          diagnoses annually. This gives Australia the highest incidence of
          melanoma anywhere in the world (Melanoma Institute Australia, 2021).
          Melanomas can easily be cut out in their early stages as a minor
          procedure, as they occur in the outer layers of the skin (Oakley,
          2015) - making them both readily visible to doctors to find the
          cancer, but also easily removed. However, if a melanoma is not removed
          at an early stage, it can metastasise, or spread to other parts of the
          body. When this occurs, the melanoma is incurable, and will eventually
          result in the death of the patient. Once metastatic, melanoma is among
          the deadliest cancers, with few available chemotherapy options
          (Oakley, 2015).<br /><br />The MelaNoMore team’s main goal was to
          create an application that would help General Practitioners identify
          if a skin lesion is a melanoma by providing them a “second opinion”
          from a Machine Learning model as to a skin lesion’s classification
          (and the probability of being that classification). During project
          development we saw an opportunity to also provide bulk
          importing/automation functionality to make this process quicker for
          doctors (and in turn getting patient results back faster which as
          mentioned previously is very important in attempting to remove the
          melanoma).

            <h3>Cross Platform.</h3>
            <p>
              The MelaNoMore application uses the Electron library which allows
              us to run web applications inside of a chromium shell and get
              native desktop functionality (run Node.js, Python and other
              executables, storage on disk etc). Furthermore, Electron is cross
              compatible with Windows, Mac OS and Linux and since we are using
              web technologies, a web version could be developed with a few
              minor modifications to the codebase and a cloud provider.
            </p>

            <h3>Offline.</h3>
            <p>
              Confidentiality and security is crucial for any healthcare
              software application as medical records contain personal/sensitive
              information that needs to be private for a variety of legal and
              ethical reasons. Hence, we designed our application to be fully
              offline. No internet or network of any kind required. This is
              because our CNN runs quickly on consumer PCs and so processing can
              be done locally. As well as the Electron’s OS interface which
              allows us to save patient data in our software’s application data.

            />
            <h3>Bulk Importing.</h3>
            <p>
              Doctor can create a CSV file, following a strict schema we
              provide, using a program such as Microsoft Office Excel and fill
              out the form data for our application for multiple patients using
              different rows. For example, instead of a doctor filling out 50
              individual patient forms in the MelaNoMore application (having to
              wait a few minutes for each to process before going on to the
              next), the doctor can create a table containing the form data of
              the 50 patients and only have to do one “bulk import”.
